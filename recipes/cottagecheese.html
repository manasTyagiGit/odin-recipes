    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
    <p>       
        The process for making Cottage Cheese involves good dairy bacteria converting lactose to lactic acid. 
        After the bacteria culture activity begins, the milk acidity increases until the milk coagulates into 
        a solid curd that can be cut into small cubes. The curd is then cooked to release moisture, then the 
        curd is chilled to make cottage cheese. Cream can be added to the finished cheese to increase the 
        richness and texture.

    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Milk (dairy)</li>
        <li>Couple of Lemons/Vinegar/Liquid Rennet</li>
        <li>Cheesecloth</li>        
    </ul>

    <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Begin by heating the milk to 86°F (30°C). I do this by placing the gallon of milk in a pot 
                or sink of very warm water. If you do this in a pot on the stove make sure you heat the 
                milk slowly and stir it well as it heats. Once the milk is at 86°F the culture can be added. 
                I do this by sprinkling the powder over the surface of the milk and then allow about 2 minutes 
                for the powder to re-hydrate before stirring it in.

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Next add about 8-10 drops of single strength liquid rennet. The milk now needs to sit quiet 
                for 5-8 hours while the culture works and the curd forms. The thermal mass of this milk should 
                keep it warm but during colder months wrapping this in a thick blanket or towel will keep the 
                temperature up. It is OK if the temp drops a few degrees during this time. When the curd is ready 
                you will notice that it shrinks away from the sides of the pan a bit and that you may see a thin 
                layer of whey on the top. You may even notice some cracks forming on the surface.

            <p>
                Now it is time to cut the curds. Begin by making parallel cuts about 1/2 -3/4 inches apart. 
                Then turn the pot 90 degrees and repeat ending with a checkerboard of cuts on the surface. 
                Then with your spoon or ladle cut these crosswise until you have a pot full of curd cubes. 
                Be gentle at this point because the curd will be very soft. Once the curds are cut, stir 
                them gently for 10 minutes. You should note more whey being released.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                Now it is time to begin drying out the curds. This will be done by increasing the heat 
                slowly to 113-115°F (45-46°C). The heat needs to be increased slowly at about 2-3°F 
                (1°C) every 5 minutes. The total cooking time will be 60-90 minutes and may be extended 
                to 2 hrs if the curds are still soft. The final curds should be cooked well through and 
                should be examined to make sure that enough moisture has been removed. A broken curd 
                should be firm throughout and the curds should have a moderate resistance when pressed 
                between the fingers.

                The dry curds can now be transferred to a colander lined with butter muslin. They should 
                be allowed to drain for 30 minutes and a gentle stirring will make sure that the whey 
                drains off. Once the curds drain for a short time the cloth can be gathered, tied securely 
                and hung for the final drainage. This can be done for several hours and even overnight, 
                depending on how dry you want the final cheese.

        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                The curds now need to be chilled and separated. I do this by filling the pot with cold 
                water and submerging the curds in its cloth bundle in the cold water (this makes it 
                easier to drain them again). Separate the curds well while in the cold water. 
                This will drop the temperature of the curds to about 60°F (15.5°C). 
                Then drain the curds again. Repeat this again but with ice water and allow the curds 
                to remain in the water for 30 minutes while separating the curds.curds are cut, stir 
                them gently for 10 minutes. You should note more whey being released.
            </p>

        <li>
            <p>
                Allow the curds to drain well in a colander. You may notice that the finished curds 
                have consolidated somewhat but they are easy to separate. You can now add a bit of 
                salt to suit your preference (about 1/4-1/2 tsp should do). Sprinkle this over the 
                surface evenly then mix into the curds well. Salt is not really needed here for the 
                process because the final acidity is enough to stop the bacteria from working. So if 
                you are looking for salt free, this is a good cheese for you. Adding herbs or spice 
                is a great alternative to augment the flavor in a salt-free cheese.Your Cheese is now 
                ready for storage but you can make any additions you like by adding fresh herbs, 
                spices, etc.

                You can now sit back and enjoy your very own dish of Cottage Cheese or just pack it into
                a sanitized container for the fridge. That's it, time for lunch and for me to enjoy a 
                fresh batch of Cottage Cheese with chives and cream added. Yum!
