    <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Put a large pot of salted water (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat. 
                It can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water), so 
                prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.
            </p>

                In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium high heat. Add the ground beef and cook 
                until it is lightly browned on all sides. Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. 
                Drain off all but a tablespoon of fat.

                Add the diced bell pepper and onions to skillet. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent
                and the peppers softened. Add the minced garlic and cook half a minute more. Return the browned ground beef 
                to the pan. Stir to combine, reduce the heat to low and cook for another 5 minutes.
            </p>

                Transfer the beef mixture to a medium sized (3- to 4-quart) pot. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and 
                tomato paste to the pot. Add the parsley, oregano, and Italian seasonings, adjusting the amounts to taste. 
                Sprinkle with garlic powder and/or garlic salt, to taste. Sprinkle with red or white wine vinegar. 
                Stir in sugar, a tablespoon at a time, tasting after each addition, to taste. Add salt to taste, and note that 
                you will later be adding Parmesan, which is salty. Bring the sauce to a simmer and then lower the heat to maintain 
                a low simmer. Cook for 15 to 45 minutes, stirring often. Scrape the bottom of the pot every so often so nothing 
                sticks to the bottom and scorches. Remove from heat.
            </p>

                By now the salted water you started heating in step one should be boiling. Add the dry lasagna noodles and cook them
                to al dente, per package directions. Stir often to prevent from sticking. Make sure that water remains at a full 
                rolling boil during the entire cooking to prevent noodles from sticking. When ready, drain in a colander and rinse 
                with cool water, gently separating any noodles that may be sticking together. Spread a little olive oil on a large 
                rimmed baking sheet, and lay out the cooked noodles on this sheet, turning them over so that they get coated with 
                a little of the olive oil. This will prevent them from sticking together.

                In a 9x13-inch casserole or lasagna dish, ladle a cup of sauce and spread it over the bottom of the dish. Arrange 
                one layer of lasagna noodles lengthwise (about 3 long noodles, edge may overlap, depending on your pan) over the 
                sauce. Ladle a third of the remaining sauce over the noodles. Sprinkle a layer of a third of the grated mozzarella 
                on top of lasagna sauce. Add half of the ricotta cheese, by placing cheese dollops every couple inches. Sprinkle 
                half the grated parmesan cheese evenly over the top of ricotta cheese. Apply second layer of noodles, top it with 
                half of the remaining sauce. Add half of the remaining Mozzarella, the remaining ricotta cheese, and another the 
                remaining Parmesan. Finish with another layer of noodles. Spread the remaining sauce over the top layer of noodles 
                and sprinkle with the remaining Mozzarella cheese.

                Cover the lasagna pan with aluminum foil, tented slightly so it doesn't touch the noodles or sauce). Bake at 375Â°F 
                for 45 minutes. Uncover in the last 10 minutes if you'd like more of a crusty top or edges.

                Allow the lasagna to cool at least 15 before serving. Leftovers will keep for about 5 days. May be reheated in conventional oven or microwave. Leave aluminum
                tent on for storage. (Try to keep the aluminum foil from touching the sauce.)
